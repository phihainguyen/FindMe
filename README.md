# FindMe

This web app takes in users input to a survey, searches and matching the user to a person based on the answers of the user. I used jQuery, HTML, and CSS to design this app. Express.js was used to make post and get request to a js file which stored the many different users responses in a JSON format on Heroku.

To start click on the Survey button seen on the home screen.

This will take users to a page where they are asked to fill out answers to a multiple choice survey.

At the end of the survey when completed, click on the submit button located at the bottom of the page.

Once submitted the web app will run an algorithm to find the closes matching person based on the answers that the user have submitted.
